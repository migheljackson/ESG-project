    (Aberdeen Standard Investments) "Responsible investing drives better outcomes for...our communities and the planet." (Nuveen) &nbsp;
    "...we are helping our investors meet their sustainability objectives in a way that only active management can." (PGIM/Prudential Financial)
    "...in pursuit of a better world...improving long-term societal outcomes." (Calvert)
    "...you can seek to generate measurable sustainable outcomes" (iShares by BlackRock)

    <div> <p>The EPI concludes, "...good policy results are associated with wealth (GDP per capita), meaning that economic prosperity makes it possible for nations to
      invest in policies and programs that lead to desirable outcomes. This trend is especially true for issue categories under the umbrella of environmental
      health, as building the necessary infrastructure to provide clean drinking water and sanitation, reduce ambient air pollution, control hazardous waste, and
      respond to public health crises yields large returns for human well-being.

      Second, the pursuit of economic prosperity – manifested in industrialization and urbanization – often means more pollution and other strains on
      ecosystem vitality, especially in the developing world, where air and water emissions remain significant. But at the same time, the data suggest countries
      need not sacrifice sustainability for economic security or vice versa."</p>
    </div>
    <div><p>The CCPI states, "...it is important to note that more than half of the CCPI ranking indicators are qualified in relative terms (better/worse) rather than absolute.
      Therefore even those countries with high rankings have no reason to sit back and relax. On the contrary, the results illustrate that even if all countries were as committed as
      the current frontrunners, efforts would still not be sufficient to prevent dangerous climate change...Even the goals of net
      zero by 2050 or 2060 from Asia are insufficient for a 1.5°C world."<p>
      </div>
      <div><p>GSCI: "Sustainable competitiveness means that current wealth levels are not in danger of being reduced or diminished through over-exploitation of resources (i.e.
        natural and human resources), the lack of innovation investments required to compete in the globalised markets (i.e. education), or the discrimination,
        marginalisation or exploitation of segments of a society.

        The leading nations on the GSCI ranking are mostly high-income countries, suggesting a certain correlation between Sustainable Competitiveness score and GDP
        per capita, or income levels (high income = high sustainability). The same is true when visualizing average deviations of GDP per capita and the sustainable
        competitiveness score.

        ... Resource economies (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait) are ranked significantly below
        their GDP ranks. This indicates that the correlation is not from GDP to sustainable competitiveness, but rather from sustainable competitiveness to income levels. In
        other words: higher sustainable competitiveness can be associated with higher income levels."</p>

<p></p>"Currently, the (ESG) ratings are inconsistent and incomplete, an indication of the work that lies ahead. A Wall Street Journal analysis of ESG grades issued for nearly 1,500 companies by three rating firms found that nearly two-thirds—942 companies—got different grades from different raters. The Journal collected ratings from the websites of three prominent ratings firms in May—Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., MSCI Inc. and Sustainalytics—and identified 1,469 companies scored by all three.  Nearly a third of the companies were deemed ESG leaders by one or more rating firms, but labeled ESG laggards by one or another rater. Credit ratings, by contrast, are broadly consistent."
